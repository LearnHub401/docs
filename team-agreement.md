## Conflict Plan

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Start with direct communication, escalate to team meeting, then advance to instructor intervention if we can't meet for a rock fight.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Raise the concern to the group, talk about how to handle the situation, and figure out how to move forward.

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Knowing our strengths and areas we'd like to focus on during this project, we will coordinate our daily work to achieve the goals each member has, while also utilizing our strengths efficiently.

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Address the member directly to figure out what blockers may be causing the issue, then figure out a solution that takes the group into account. Keep group/personal dev time in mind when blockers are met.
